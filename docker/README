# üê≥ Docker Setup for DRDA

This folder contains two Docker Compose environments to launch the ROS master and COMPAS RRC driver containers for real and simulated ABB robots.

---

## üè≠ real_bringup/ ‚Äî For Real ABB Robots

Use this setup to control **physical ABB** robots over Ethernet via the OmniCore controller.

**Launch:**
```bash
cd docker/real_bringup
docker compose up --build

```
Checklist:

-Make sure robots are powered, reachable via IP (e.g. 192.168.0.10)

-Robot must be in Auto mode

-Streaming ports 30101 and 30201 should be open

---

## ü§ñ virtual_bringup/ ‚Äî For RobotStudio Simulation

Use this setup to control virtual robots in ABB RobotStudio on your local machine.

```bash
cd docker/virtual_bringup
docker compose up --build
```
-RobotStudio must be open and simulation running

-IP should match your virtual controller (often 127.0.0.1 or 192.168.125.1)
